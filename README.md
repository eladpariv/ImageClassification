# Image Classification with TensorFlow

Introduction
This repository contains a Python script ImageClassification.ipynb that demonstrates image classification using TensorFlow.
The script walks through the process of building a deep learning model for classifying images of cats and dogs.
It includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and testing.

Dependencies
Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

TensorFlow
OpenCV (cv2)
Matplotlib
You can install them via pip:

Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the ImageClassification.ipynb file in a Jupyter notebook environment such as Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
Detailed Description
Install Dependencies and Setup: Installs necessary Python libraries and sets up the environment.
Load Data: Loads image data from the specified directory using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory function. It also 
displays a sample of the loaded images.
Scale Data: Scales the image data by dividing pixel values by 255 to ensure values are between 0 and 1.
Split Data: Splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Build Deep Learning Model: Constructs a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Sequential API, consisting of convolutional and fully 
connected layers for image classification.
Train: Trains the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs, with validation data for monitoring performance.
Plot Performance: Plots the training and validation loss curves and accuracy curves to visualize model performance.
Evaluate: Evaluates the trained model on the test set using metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy.
Test: Tests the model on custom images of cats and dogs to make predictions.
Conclusion
This script provides a comprehensive example of image classification using TensorFlow, covering data preprocessing, model building,
training, evaluation, and testing. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing image classification tasks with deep learning.
